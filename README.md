# Security Management and Governance, Royal Holloway, University of London

## Course description

This course will look at some of the key components of practical cyber security
management and its governance. This includes what happens when things go wrong,
understanding how organisations can respond to incidents, through to the essential role
of people in achieving better cyber security outcomes. Together, you will examine how
incident management, cyber resilience, and developing an effective appreciation of
people, not simply as users but as active participants, can enable better cyber security
outcomes.

The topics covered include:

- Identifying what an incident is
- Incident preparation, planning, and response
- Cyber resilience
- The role of people in security management
- The building of trust and developing positive cyber security cultures
  
## Course goals and outcomes

The goal of the course is to introduce two key components for effective security
management. This incorporates: 1. the role that incident management plays in a world
of increasing interdependency, and; 2. understanding how people intersect with cyber
security and organisations, whether as employees, customers, or more broadly in
society. Together, these provide a foundation to start thinking and practicing security
management in real-life scenarios.

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

1. Identify and implement different controls for the management of people in
organisations
2. Describe and identify what an incident is and how to prioritise them
3. Assess how to report incidents and effective mechanisms for building resilience
for an organisation
4. Compare different incident response actions according to an organisation’s
needs

Incident response and assessing incidents | **Key concepts**:<br /> Incident Planning; Incident Response Teams; Incident Reporting. <br /> **Learning outcomes**: <br />• Assess how to report incidents and effective mechanisms for building resilience for an organization. <br />• Compare different incident response actions according to an organization's needs. |
| Week 3. People and cyber security | **Key concepts**:<br /> People; Security Vetting; Contracting <br /> **Learning outcomes**: <br />• Develop an appreciation of the different types of people and how to manage competing interests in an ISMS. <br />• Identify and implement different controls for the management of people in organizations. |
| Week 4. A security management ecosystem | **Key concepts**:<br /> Security Awareness Training; Trust; Acceptable Use Policies <br /> **Learning outcomes**: <br />• Evaluate the impact of integration of people-centric security into an ISMS. |


## Activities of this course
The course is comprised of the following elements:

- Lecture videos.
  - Lectures broadly divided into four weeks that evolve from theoretical foundation to security management and governance in action.
- Readings.
  - Many resources on the web, which included in this course, provide good source
of information to expand on the lecture videos.
- Investigating activities.
  - Conducting web search and recording findings to a study journal.
- Peer Reviewed Assignment.
  - One peer reviewed assignment that needs to pass by providing constructive
feedback to peers and discuss what you can learn from their work.
- Discussion Prompt.
  - There are many activities included in discussion prompts in every week which
you will need to complete and share outputs on discission forum. It is strongly
recommended that learners engage in these debates with their fellow peers.
- Graded quizzes.
  - There is a graded quiz in the end of each week.

# US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) 800-61

In this reading, you will be exploring the first two sections of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) 800-61. Pay attention to the number of different components that security management and governance needs to consider. When reading the material, think how this may apply in various ways to different organisations – would this work with larger and smaller organisations in similar ways, for instance?

Please read:

- Cichonski, P., T. Millar, T. Grance and K. Scarfone [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) (Gaithersburg, MD, 2012). The ‘Executive Summary’ and 2.1 of NIST SP 800-61.

### 5 Key Elements of a Modern Cybersecurity Framework

Most organizations base their cybersecurity approach on an established model like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The five key functions in the framework are:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

# Incident management planning

In this reading, you will engage with the UK National Cyber Security Centre's (NCSC) high-level overview to incident management planning. Pay particular attention to how this relates to ISO/IEC 27005-2, “Guidelines to plan and prepare for incident response” addressed in the previous lecture.  You may also wish to compare this to NIST SP 800-61.

## Additional material

If you wish to read about cyber resilience (the focus of the next video) and how it can help in assisting with thinking about preparation for incidents and thinking more broadly, please read Hausken, K. ‘[Cyber resilience in firms, organizations and societies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iot.2020.100204)’, Internet of Things 11 2020, 100204.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre defines cyber resillience as *"a measure of how readily a system can persist in a changing environment."*
