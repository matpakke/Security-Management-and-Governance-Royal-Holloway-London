# Security Management and Governance, Royal Holloway, University of London

## Course description

This course will look at some of the key components of practical cyber security
management and its governance. This includes what happens when things go wrong,
understanding how organisations can respond to incidents, through to the essential role
of people in achieving better cyber security outcomes. Together, you will examine how
incident management, cyber resilience, and developing an effective appreciation of
people, not simply as users but as active participants, can enable better cyber security
outcomes.

The topics covered include:

- Identifying what an incident is
- Incident preparation, planning, and response
- Cyber resilience
- The role of people in security management
- The building of trust and developing positive cyber security cultures
  
## Course goals and outcomes

The goal of the course is to introduce two key components for effective security
management. This incorporates: 1. the role that incident management plays in a world
of increasing interdependency, and; 2. understanding how people intersect with cyber
security and organisations, whether as employees, customers, or more broadly in
society. Together, these provide a foundation to start thinking and practicing security
management in real-life scenarios.

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

1. Identify and implement different controls for the management of people in
organisations
2. Describe and identify what an incident is and how to prioritise them
3. Assess how to report incidents and effective mechanisms for building resilience
for an organisation
4. Compare different incident response actions according to an organisation’s
needs
