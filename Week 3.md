## Walking the line: The everyday security ties that bind

 In this reading, you will explore how information security can be considered from a socio-technical perspective. This reading is purposefully broad and is intended to challenge. Pay attention to terms positive and negative security as well as the examples of security controls and the models applied in section 4. These may be required later!

## Procedural and people security controls

There are a range of people-related controls that will be the topic of the next lecture. In preparation for this, please read:

- 3.14 Personnel Security (pp. 222 - 228) of the NIST SP 800-53, "[Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf)."

Whilst completing this reading, think about what may be missing or unusual in your expectations. This may be something to return back to after the next lecture.

Assess the different methods and controls that can be used in an information security management system to assist in developing better protection for prganizations.

Various different security controls produce outcomes that may or may not be favourable to the organization and people we are seeking to secure

Outline's the organization's:
- Security policies
- Aims
- Objectives

Must be supported by:
- Clearly documented
- Easily accessible
- Readable

Security Policies

*Documentation is at the core of security managemnt.*

When developing management strategies for people, we must

1. Have buy-in from the top of an organization
2. Develop clear documentation
3. Understand how people communicate with the security team, and what types of experiences they have
4. Consider how security cntrols will affect people differently
5. Apply controls selectively and assess how they align with the organization's broader aims and objectives.

# Vetting and Contracting

Guilding employees through business entails:
- their entry
- Their time within the organization
- their time to leave it

Organizations need to plan for the different stages of their employees, including:
- Contractors
- Third parties
- Capacity to effectively manage legal duties
- Ensure effective and fair terms for employees
- Ensure there is appropriate documentation that is transparent and clear

# Developing Awareness and 'Good' Practice 

**Generally in security management and governance. We wish to pursue as much Positive forms of Sucurity as posible and to limit the use of Negative Security.**

*Do not trust a person's word that they are, who they say they are, or that they will act appropriately.*

"Negative Security" as *the freedom from something* contracts and appropriate vetting procedures to ensure that there is a minimum standard of compliance with an organisation's security policies that is legally robust and is clearly articulated to all parties.

**"Positive Security"** as *the freedom to do something* accepable use policies, what is permitted and encouraged. Acceptable use policies are however often 'boring' documents which are hiden in an organization's network

Presentation of acceptable use policies may include:
- Information security awareness
- Education
- Training

Any training must not only ask the what and how of information security, but also why people should bother

*"Personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions"* - **ISO/IEC 27002 Clause 6.3**

An ISMS must appropriately assess the balance of cost and intended impact

1. Compliance-based metrics, which assess relatively easily and quantitatively how much traning has been completed.

2. Impact-based assessment of metrics, which look at changes in behavior over time
