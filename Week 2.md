# Week 2

This week you will learn how to identify and prioritise incidents, their planning and preparation, responding to incidents as well as learning and assessing from (inevitable) incidents that organisations encounter.

*"Proactive detection refers to devices, people and/or mechanisms that are actively searching for vulnerabilities that can potentially be security events."* - **ISO/IEC 27035-3, Clause 7.3.3**

## Activity: Information sharing partnerships

In the last lecture, you explored what it might mean to identify an incident through different data feeds. This is because contemporary cyber security and its management and governance requires significant amounts of data to develop situational awareness and to identify anomalies in networks and processes.

Respond to the following statement:

‘Information sharing partnerships offer little value to incident management and response.’

In your response, consider what information sharing partnerships are, their different forms (e.g. government or industry-led), as well as the speed and scope of information and data sharing in partnerships. You may wish to also reflect on additional aspects.

Record your response in the study journal.

  - This reading looks at the case of the Australian financial services sector. In this piece, reflect on whether IRTs should be understood as 'firefighters' or not, and what the issues with such an approach may be, thinking back to the concept of 'cyber resilience' and broader planning for information security incidents.

In the field of contemporary cybersecurity, incident management and response are critical components for safeguarding digital assets and protecting against cyber threats. To achieve effective incident management and response, significant amounts of data are required to develop situational awareness and identify anomalies in networks and processes. Information sharing partnerships play a vital role in this context and are far from offering little value; they are essential in strengthening overall cybersecurity capabilities.

Information sharing partnerships are collaborative arrangements between various entities, such as government agencies, private industries, cybersecurity firms, and other relevant stakeholders. These partnerships are designed to facilitate the exchange of critical cybersecurity-related information, including threat intelligence, indicators of compromise (IOCs), attack patterns, and defensive strategies. The primary aim is to collectively enhance the ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber incidents efficiently.

One significant advantage of information sharing partnerships is their ability to provide a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of the threat landscape. By pooling data from various sources, these partnerships can offer a broader perspective on emerging threats and ongoing attacks. Government-led partnerships can leverage intelligence agencies' resources and classified information, while industry-led partnerships can tap into the experiences of private sector organizations facing similar threats. This diversity of inputs allows for a more holistic approach to incident management.

Speed and scope of information sharing are crucial factors that determine the effectiveness of these partnerships. In the case of government-led partnerships, classified information may be shared promptly with relevant stakeholders, enabling faster threat identification and response. Industry-led partnerships can provide insights into specific attack patterns and vulnerabilities that may affect multiple organizations within a particular sector. The rapid dissemination of such information can significantly enhance proactive defense measures and incident mitigation.

Another critical aspect is the principle of collective defense. Information sharing partnerships foster a culture of cooperation and collaboration. By sharing their own experiences and knowledge, organizations within these partnerships can benefit from the collective wisdom of the group, thus improving their individual cybersecurity posture. This is particularly vital for small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources to independently tackle sophisticated cyber threats.

Furthermore, information sharing partnerships can act as a force multiplier for incident response efforts. By leveraging shared data and intelligence, organizations can reduce duplication of efforts and streamline their response strategies. This can lead to more efficient containment and remediation of incidents, minimizing the overall impact and reducing downtime.

In conclusion, information sharing partnerships are indispensable in contemporary cybersecurity incident management and response. Their multi-faceted nature, incorporating government and industry-led initiatives, allows for a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape. The speed and scope of data sharing empower organizations to detect and respond to cyber incidents more effectively. Additionally, the principle of collective defense promotes collaboration, enabling stakeholders to collectively strengthen their cyber defenses. Emphasizing the value of information sharing partnerships is crucial in building a robust and resilient cybersecurity ecosystem capable of mitigating the ever-evolving cyber threats.

# Incident reponse teams

**Incident Response Teams (IRTs)** is *"a capability set up for the purpose of assisting in responding to computer security-related incidents"* - **NIST 800-61, Appendix C - Glossary**

- Focus is on incident response for a singular organisation 

**A CSIRT** *'consists of the people who handle the response the response to an incident. It may include internal and external teams and may differ based on the nature of the incident.'* **UK National Cyber Security Centre**

### CERT - Computer Emergencu Response Team
- Focus is one improving incident response accross industies and even countries

### SOC - Security Operations Centre

Both CERTs and SOCs are not equivalent to IRTs and CSIRTs, but may play a role in incident management.

## Three types of Incident Response Team identified in ISO/IEC 27035-2

The three types are Single, Hierarchical, and Remote. You’re right! Single IRTs are typically only responsible for one organisation; Hierarchical IRTs typically connect multiple IRTs that focus on different aspects of security in larger organisations; and Remote IRTs are typically outsourced to third parties.

# Incident response actions
are carried out across 

- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery

**Containment** *"provides a reasonable security solution until such time that sufficient information has been collected to address the vulnerabilities and the damage."* - **ISO/IEC 27035-3, Clause 11.2.1**

Containment should be considered in advance during planning for each major incident type that has been identified in conjunction with the IRT.

**Eradication** seeks to remove the problem causing an incident, including:
- Malware from systems
- Removing compromised authentication tokens
- People from the organisation

**Recovery** must be phased over time with remediation depending on the priority of different systems.

Returning systems back to their usual functioning can be complex and take a long time

## Reporting incidents
requires good documentation to enable:
- A secure and easily accessible repository of detection events
- Effective communication during, and post, incident

---

### Plan and prepare 
- Preparation of preformatted forms
- taxonomy for classifying incidents
- Defining who is responsible for dealing with incidents
- How reports should be handled and distributed

### Detection and reporting
- The production of technical reports
- How digital evidence is collected, stored and logged for forensics

### Assessment and decision
- All decisions and activities need to be logged
- Propper reporting during decision assists with remedial actions and how to learn lessons in the future

### Responses
- Ensure digital evidence is stored security
- Communication often becomes important during response - such as to law enforcement and potentially the media
- A post incident activity report should be produced

### Lessons Learnt 
- More thorough reports should be produced on the incident
- Communication may continue with legal and regulatory enforcement, such as under the EU's GDPR

# Reporting is:
- essential for legal proceedings and dealing with law enforcement
- essential for ensurinf that information security incidents likelihood is either eliminated or reduced by examination of what happeded.

## Lessons learned from an information security incident

 In this reading, you will explore how to share any lessons learned from an information security incident. The core reading focuses on how organisations may encourage and support people – particularly through senior leadership engagement and a supporting and trusting atmosphere. 

Please read:

- Tatu,  Ament, and Jaeger. (2018) ‘[Lessons learned from an information security incident: a practical recommendation to involve employees in information security](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1488&context=hicss-51).’, Proceedings of the 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

# How to learn lessons from incidents?

Lessons learnt may lead to: 
- Changing security controls
- A new or revised risk assessment
- Changes to planning, procedures, and reporting

ISO/IEC 27035-2

A balance between immediate and long-term security controls need to be considered

Risk assessments may need to be revised to reflect the changing threat landscape and organization's capacity to respons.

Lessons learnt may not just require a revision of a risk assessment but of how an organization responses to threats.

What are the five main components of incident management and response covered by ISO/IEC 27035-1? Provide each step as well as a brief description of each.

SO/IEC 27035-1 provides five different steps that incident management and response

1. Planning and preparation; ensuring that appropriate risk planning, mitigation, and responsibilities are clearly laid out as well as testing plans.

2. Detecting and reporting; ensuring that there are adequate controls in place for monitoring and reporting events. This may include both proactive and reactive forms of detection. It isimportant to keep good documentation to ensure that events are logged so that anomalies and patterns can be identified.

3. Assessment and decision; here, an organisation must have plans to decide when an event becomes an incident and who is responsible for escalation and making such a decision.

4. Responses; an organisation may have a set of different responses (and responsibilities) depending on the type of incident they are faced with. The steps can be summarised as containment, eradication, and recovery. 

5. Lessons Learnt: all organisations must understand why an incident occurring, how to prevent it in future, as well as develop better processes for response. This should be written in documentation and referred to as part of any changes to incident management and response.

Why might organisations want to engage with third parties in incident management and response? You may wish to consider both the use of data and who may respond.

There are several considerations that you may wish to think about.

First, if we turn back to the example used this week in Automotive Components Ltd, it might that an organisation does not have the capacity to have an Incident Response Team with all the different skills that are required across technical, people, and specialist skills. This may mean that a remote IRT run by a third-party may be required.

Second, (big) data has become exceptionally important in determining what the threats are as well as identifying patterns and anomalies. Data sources can be widespread, including internal data, but also in information sharing partnerships. Data is one area where the use of third parties can be particularly useful in building up collective cyber resilience. It may also be useful to use threat intelligence feeds – either open-access or paid-for – to help build greater awareness of threats to then integrated as part of incident management and response. 

Third, there may be need to speak with law enforcement or other government agencies responsible for legal compliance. This will depend on the type of incident and the jurisdiction in which the organisation operates.
