# Week 2

This week you will learn how to identify and prioritise incidents, their planning and preparation, responding to incidents as well as learning and assessing from (inevitable) incidents that organisations encounter.

*"Proactive detection refers to devices, people and/or mechanisms that are actively searching for vulnerabilities that can potentially be security events."* - **ISO/IEC 27035-3, Clause 7.3.3**

## Activity: Information sharing partnerships

In the last lecture, you explored what it might mean to identify an incident through different data feeds. This is because contemporary cyber security and its management and governance requires significant amounts of data to develop situational awareness and to identify anomalies in networks and processes.

Respond to the following statement:

‘Information sharing partnerships offer little value to incident management and response.’

In your response, consider what information sharing partnerships are, their different forms (e.g. government or industry-led), as well as the speed and scope of information and data sharing in partnerships. You may wish to also reflect on additional aspects.

Record your response in the study journal.

## Security incident management

In this reading, you will consider the different components that are required to respond to an information security incident, including incident response teams and the need to often include external actors, such as law enforcement:

  - This reading looks at the case of the Australian financial services sector. In this piece, reflect on whether IRTs should be understood as 'firefighters' or not, and what the issues with such an approach may be, thinking back to the concept of 'cyber resilience' and broader planning for information security incidents.

## Lessons learned from an information security incident

 In this reading, you will explore how to share any lessons learned from an information security incident. The core reading focuses on how organisations may encourage and support people – particularly through senior leadership engagement and a supporting and trusting atmosphere.

In the field of contemporary cybersecurity, incident management and response are critical components for safeguarding digital assets and protecting against cyber threats. To achieve effective incident management and response, significant amounts of data are required to develop situational awareness and identify anomalies in networks and processes. Information sharing partnerships play a vital role in this context and are far from offering little value; they are essential in strengthening overall cybersecurity capabilities.

Information sharing partnerships are collaborative arrangements between various entities, such as government agencies, private industries, cybersecurity firms, and other relevant stakeholders. These partnerships are designed to facilitate the exchange of critical cybersecurity-related information, including threat intelligence, indicators of compromise (IOCs), attack patterns, and defensive strategies. The primary aim is to collectively enhance the ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber incidents efficiently.

One significant advantage of information sharing partnerships is their ability to provide a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of the threat landscape. By pooling data from various sources, these partnerships can offer a broader perspective on emerging threats and ongoing attacks. Government-led partnerships can leverage intelligence agencies' resources and classified information, while industry-led partnerships can tap into the experiences of private sector organizations facing similar threats. This diversity of inputs allows for a more holistic approach to incident management.

Speed and scope of information sharing are crucial factors that determine the effectiveness of these partnerships. In the case of government-led partnerships, classified information may be shared promptly with relevant stakeholders, enabling faster threat identification and response. Industry-led partnerships can provide insights into specific attack patterns and vulnerabilities that may affect multiple organizations within a particular sector. The rapid dissemination of such information can significantly enhance proactive defense measures and incident mitigation.

Another critical aspect is the principle of collective defense. Information sharing partnerships foster a culture of cooperation and collaboration. By sharing their own experiences and knowledge, organizations within these partnerships can benefit from the collective wisdom of the group, thus improving their individual cybersecurity posture. This is particularly vital for small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources to independently tackle sophisticated cyber threats.

Furthermore, information sharing partnerships can act as a force multiplier for incident response efforts. By leveraging shared data and intelligence, organizations can reduce duplication of efforts and streamline their response strategies. This can lead to more efficient containment and remediation of incidents, minimizing the overall impact and reducing downtime.

In conclusion, information sharing partnerships are indispensable in contemporary cybersecurity incident management and response. Their multi-faceted nature, incorporating government and industry-led initiatives, allows for a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape. The speed and scope of data sharing empower organizations to detect and respond to cyber incidents more effectively. Additionally, the principle of collective defense promotes collaboration, enabling stakeholders to collectively strengthen their cyber defenses. Emphasizing the value of information sharing partnerships is crucial in building a robust and resilient cybersecurity ecosystem capable of mitigating the ever-evolving cyber threats.

# Incident reponse teams

**Incident Response Teams (IRTs)** is *"a capability set up for the purpose of assisting in responding to computer security-related incidents"* - **NIST 800-61, Appendix C - Glossary**

- Focus is on incident response for a singular organisation 

**A CSIRT** *'consists of the people who handle the response the response to an incident. It may include internal and external teams and may differ based on the nature of the incident.'* **UK National Cyber Security Centre**

### CERT - Computer Emergencu Response Team
- Focus is one improving incident response accross industies and even countries

### SOC - Security Operations Centre

Both CERTs and SOCs are not equivalent to IRTs and CSIRTs, but may play a role in incident management.

# Incident response actions
are carried out across 

- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery

**Containment** *"provides a reasonable security solution until such time that sufficient information has been collected to address the vulnerabilities and the damage."* - **ISO/IEC 27035-3, Clause 11.2.1**

Containment should be considered in advance during planning for each major incident type that has been identified in conjunction with the IRT.

**Eradication** seeks to remove the problem causing an incident, including:
- Malware from systems
- Removing compromised authentication tokens
- People from the organisation

**Recovery** must be phased over time with remediation depending on the priority of different systems.

Returning systems back to their usual functioning can be complex and take a long time
